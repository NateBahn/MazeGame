# MazeGame
Solve a maze game in Virtual Reality

I used Probuilder, Progrid, and the Unity XR Interaction Toolkit to design a maze experience for Virtual Reality. 
I used the Unity OpenVR plugin so that the game would work cross platform. For assets to create the maze I 
used the Snaps Prototype Office asset pack from the unity asset store 
(Link - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/snaps-prototype-office-137490)

Lessons learned:
1. The XR Interaction Toolkit makes developing environments for VR much easier since it is component based. 
2. The Progrid extension makes it much faster to prototype an environment that is neat and symmetrical, I will be using that again.
